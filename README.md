### ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Atticus Zambrana (Aduhkiss)

Iâ€™m a 24-year-old **backend engineer** and **infrastructure builder** at **Starbound Stories LLC**.  
My focus is on **scalable systems, data integrity, and operational reliability** â€” whether thatâ€™s powering large Minecraft networks, handling secure payments, or shipping real-time dashboards.  

Recently, Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into **Next.js/React** to round out my frontend skills, while keeping my strength solidly in the backend.
