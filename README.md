### Hi there, my name is Atticus! ðŸ‘‹

Yo! My name is Atticus! I write code in my free time.

I love writing for the Bukkit/Spigot Minecraft Server API, as well as the BungeeCord API
I have experience developing and implementing backend infrastructure for Minecraft Servers.

I'm the guy you want to have in-charge of developing your next big server.
