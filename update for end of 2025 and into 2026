### ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Atticus Zambrana (Aduhkiss)

Iâ€™m a 24 year old **Java engineer**, **infrastructure-focused builder**, and **security-minded developer** at **Starbound Stories LLC**. I design and ship real-time systemsâ€”especially around **Minecraft server infrastructure**, **AI moderation**, and **data-heavy dashboards**â€”with a strong emphasis on reliability, observability, and safety.

I also have a **thorough, practical understanding of AI and how to use it**: LLM orchestration, prompt/system design, tool/function calling, policy/safety enforcement, evaluation, and cost/perf tuning in production.
